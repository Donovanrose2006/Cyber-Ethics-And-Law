# My Ethical Lens
A framework that fits me would be Phenomenology. It fits me because I like to try things before deciding my opinions on them. Actual experience feels more important than just assigning opinions to things.
# Authorization Principle
Autorization is confirmation of someone having the ability to access a resource. An example would be the captive portal for the student internet at Hocking,where you need to input a username and password to access it.
# Policy Snippet 
Use of lab network resources is limited to authorized users for educational or research purposes within assigned scope. Users must access only resources for which they have explicit permission and must not perform testing, scanning, or data collection beyond approved tasks. Personal data shall be minimized and handled responsibly. Suspected exposure or misuse must be reported immediately to Campus Safety (111-111-1111). Violations may result in loss of access and disciplinary action.
# Reflection Notes
It would do better to be more precise with the policy paragraph. Stakeholders would also have to comply with the new policy as well. It may seem like a nuisance to some users but it would heavily benefit any administrators.
