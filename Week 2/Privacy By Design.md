# Principles Summary
Notice and consent is used to make sure whoever is using your service knows what they are agreeing to by disclosing that information to them as soon as they begin to use it. Purpose limitation is used to disclose that the information gathered will only be used for the specific purposes laid out in the agreement. Data minimization gives a set amount of data the service provider is allowed to collect, which they must disclose in the AUP as well. Proportionality and Necessity is the least amount of control that still minimizes risk of data ending up in the wrong hands.
# Clause
Trinity College monitors student internet access to protect operations and comply with policy. 
Monitoring is limited to safety and legal purposes and will not be used, under any circumstances, for commercial or research purposes by the college. Users receive notice at sign-in and through the AUP; personal communications are not reviewed except as required by law or incident response. 
Trinity College collects the minimum data necessary, restricts access to trained staff, and retains monitoring data for 1 week unless required longer for investigations or legal holds. Individuals may raise concerns or appeal via Trinity College Main Office (123-456-7890). Violations may result in loss of access and disciplinary action.
# Justification
One of the principles I used was notice and consent, telling the users exactly what was expected of them. The entire AUP itself outlines this.
# Reflection
Wish the AUP itself could be shorter. The more straight and to the point these are, the more likely the consumer will actually read them.
