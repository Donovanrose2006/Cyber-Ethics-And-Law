# License Choice
The MIT license is the simplest of the three, giving users permission to use, copy, modify, merge, distribute, or sell copies of the software. For MIT obligations, it is a must to preserve the copyright and MIT license text in source and accept the warranty disclaimer, that doesn’t make any promises or claim any liability. The Apache License 2.0 grants users permission to use, modify, or distribute the software for any purpose and grants a patent license to contributors for their contributions. The Apache License obligations are to keep the copyright and license text, preserve the NOTICE file, and mark modified files and include a note of the changes. GPL requires source code to be readable, and the copyright and patent text must remain intact in the source code.

At a high level, the issue can be reproduced when [General Steps to Reproduce — no exploit code]. The current behavior is [Observed Behavior], whereas the expected behavior is [Expected Behavior].

The potential impact of this issue is [Impact, e.g., information disclosure, privilege escalation, denial of service], and the reporter assesses the severity as [Low/Medium/High/Critical]. Systems or users likely to be affected include [Affected Users/Systems].

# Reflection
I would refine it to hopefully be a bit more concise in the future, and stakeholders would enjoy it because they can actually report vulnerabilities.
# AI use note
I used Chat-GPT to draft up the Initial Vulnerability Report Template, asking it "Can you please make me an Initial Vulnerability Report Template for an organization in paragraph form", and then made my own tweaks to it
