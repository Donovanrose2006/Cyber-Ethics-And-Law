# Lab/Project Ethics Addendum (final)
- Protocol Approval and Roles
  - A designated faculty member will be responsible for supervision of all research activities, and will assume responsibility for ethical and safety compliance
  - Any participants will be monitored with their usage of the wearables. If any participant has any adverse reactions to the wearable or seems to be negatively affected, it is the duty of all participants to alert a faculty member of any reaction that the participant or any other participant is experiencing. Trained medical professionals will be onsite and prepared.
- Informed Consent
  - Every participant will receive a copy of the consent form they signed before the research began, which explained the purpose of the wearable.
  - There are risks associated with the wearable, which have been acknowledged. The benefits have been deemed to outweigh the risks, and the value of the research will assist greatly in any future advancement.
  - If concerns are too great, any participant may opt-out and leave the program at any time.
- Scope & Prohibitions
  - No self-experimentation is permitted without oversight from a faculty member.
  - No medical procedures are necessary for the wearables.
  - Only the approved wearables may be used for research.
- Data Handling
  - Only the minimum necessary data will be collected, such as any adverse reactions or any odd behaviors from the wearable. 
  - This data will only be held for 90 days, after which will be destroyed, and names and other biological identifiers will be redacted at all times.
  - Only the faculty members involved with the research will be able to access the data from this research.
# Equity & Access Analysis
The person with the wearable/BCI often benefits and anyone else TECHNICALLY loses, but it should not be seen this way. The possibility of inequity arises due the differences between people with/without wearables and people who can't afford them. This inequity can be dealt with by addressing it and setting a limit on what can be used, but may not be the best solution.
# Justification
"Today’s, prosthetics can not only restore, but also enhance, physical abilities – sometimes surpassing what is considered “normal” human performance" (Weber 107). These prostheticsm however, are barely in use today and still need research. More than likely, we will moreso have more restrictions on the people who use them rather than people who do not, unless medically required.

# Reflection
A lot of these concerns don't apply yet, but they will soon. Honestly, a bit concerned if we're still not prepared enough.
